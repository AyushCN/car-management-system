## Features

- Add new cars to the system
- View a list of all cars in the fleet
- Update car details (e.g., model, manufacturer, registration)
- Delete a car from the system
- Track maintenance schedules for each vehicle
- Search and filter cars based on various parameters

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Node.js / Express (or specify your backend stack)
- **Frontend**: React.js (or specify your frontend framework)
- **Database**: MongoDB / MySQL / PostgreSQL (choose your database)
- **Authentication**: JWT / OAuth2 (if applicable)
- **Styling**: CSS / TailwindCSS (if applicable)

    ```

3. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:
